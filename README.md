# What
Use this tool to convert old Chrome apps to a normal shortcut.

# Why
Chrome decided that people suddenly does not need the "Create a shortcut" apps that you were able to create directly from chrome, from wich you could open webpages as a seperate window. 

This script converts those Chrome apps into normal shortcuts that you can place on the desktop.
